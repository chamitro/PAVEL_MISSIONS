## 🎮 How to Play

### Game Setup

**Important:** This is a **local multiplayer game** - all players share the same device and take turns!

1. **Gather Your Group** - Get 2-10 friends together around one device
2. **Explore the Scrolls** - Read about the world, heroes, and rules through interactive parchment scrolls
3. **Choose Party Size** - Select how many players are joining
4. **Register Players** - Each player enters their name and receives a unique hero (no duplicates!)
5. **Set Quest Length** - Decide on 5-70 challenges (includes 20 group missions in the pool)
6. **Pass the Device** - Players take turns as indicated by the game

### Core Mechanics

**Turn Structure:**
- The game indicates whose turn it is with visual highlighting
- **Player to your left** draws a challenge card and chooses difficulty: Minor (1 Glory) or Deadly (2 Glory)
- **Active player** receives the device and decides their approach to the challenge
- After completing your turn, **pass the device** to the next player

**Resource Management:**
- 5 Attributes: **POW** (Power), **SPD** (Speed), **BRN** (Brain), **CHA** (Charisma), **WIL** (Willpower)
- Spend attribute points to meet challenge requirements
- **Spent points are consumed** and don't regenerate automatically
- Winning a challenge grants **+2 points back** to the stat you used!

**Soul-Type Advantage:**
- If your hero's Soul-Type matches the challenge affinity, receive **+3 automatic bonus**
- 10 Different affinities: Dark, Tech, Stone, Crowd, Magic, Shadow, Sky, Pub, Silent, Undead

**Decision Options Each Turn:**

1. **Do the Challenge** - Spend attribute points to overcome and gain Glory
2. **Pass (Meditation)** - Skip the challenge, restore nothing (limited to 3 per game)
3. **Challenge a Friend** - Engage another player in competitive dual challenge
   - Challenger gets **+2 courage bonus** for initiating
   - Both succeed → Both gain Glory
   - One succeeds → Solo winner gets **double** Glory
   - Both fail → No Glory earned
   - **No dice gambling** in friend challenges - pure skill and mind games!

**Drink & Gamble:**
- If you fail a regular challenge, sacrifice a drink to roll the dice (1-6) for bonus points
- Can turn defeat into victory with a lucky roll!
- **Not available in Friend Challenges or Group Missions**

**Recovery System:**
- The Alchemist appears periodically based on party size and progression
- Restore **10 total points** distributed across your attributes as you choose
- Visit frequency increases as the game progresses (dynamic difficulty scaling)
- Plan your resource usage carefully!

**Victory Condition:**
- Player with the highest Glory score when all challenges are complete wins
- Ties are broken by total remaining stat points
- Hall of Victors tracks cumulative wins across all games!

## 👥 Group Missions

Sometimes the entire party faces a **Group Mission** (marked with 🤝). These cooperative challenges require **ALL heroes to work together**!

### How Group Missions Work

1. **Voting Phase** - Each player votes YES or NO to participate
2. **All-or-Nothing** - If anyone votes NO, the mission is skipped entirely (move to next card)
3. **Contribution Phase** - Each participating player contributes stat points (in turn order)
4. **Affinity Bonuses Apply** - Players still get +3 if their soul-type matches
5. **Passive Abilities Work** - Lost Dragon's Dragon Rage, Neighbor Witch's Arcane Alliance, and more!
6. **Combined Total** - All contributions are added together (including bonuses)

### Rewards & Penalties

**If the party succeeds:**
- ✅ **Easy Mode:** All participants gain **+2 Glory**
- ✅ **Hard Mode:** All participants gain **+4 Glory**
- ✅ **Stat Refund:** +2 to the stat you contributed (if you contributed)
- ✅ **Thug Dwarf:** Gains +3 POW (Brute Force passive triggers)
- ✅ **Babbler Rogue:** Counts toward Crowd Favorite bonus
- ✅ **Lover Zombie:** Cursed Embrace triggers (if participating)

**If the party fails:**
- ❌ **Only participants lose -3 to ALL stats** (POW, SPD, BRN, CHA, WIL)
- ❌ No Glory for anyone
- ❌ No gambling - failure is absolute
- ❌ Players who voted NO are unaffected

### Special Rules for Group Missions

- **No Dice Rolls** - Drunken Paladin cannot use Liquid Courage
- **Everyone Chooses** - Can vote YES to participate or NO to skip
- **Friendly AI** - Can use System Override to contribute a different stat
- **Neighbor Witch** - Can borrow from another player's required stat
- **Coordination is Key** - Discuss strategy before committing!

### Example Group Missions

- 🌊 **The Great Swamp Flood** - Pavel is sinking! Bail water together!
- 🐉 **Dragon's Siege** - A dragon attacks the pub! Fight as one!
- 🍺 **The King's Banquet** - King Antony needs 5000 beers NOW!
- 👹 **Ork Horde Stand** - Push back the invaders at the pub door!
- 🔥 **Village Fire Brigade** - The pub is burning! Pass water bags quickly!

## 🎯 Game Strategy Tips

### General Strategy

1. **Master Your Passive** - Each hero's passive ability can turn the tide; learn when to use it
2. **Resource Conservation** - You get +2 back on wins, but losses hurt. Spend wisely!
3. **Use Meditations Wisely** - You only have 3 for the entire game (except Mute Monk)
4. **Friend Challenges** - Great for difficult challenges when resources are low
5. **Soul-Type Matching** - The +3 bonus can make impossible challenges achievable
6. **Group Mission Coordination** - Don't let the party down! Communicate strategy
7. **Watch the Alchemist Schedule** - Visits become more frequent as the game progresses

### Hero-Specific Tips

- **Dark Stalker**: Use Shadow Control before big challenges to skip strong opponents or force meditation at critical moments
- **Friendly AI**: Save System Override for impossible challenges or group missions where you lack the required stat
- **Thug Dwarf**: Snowballs hard - prioritize winning early challenges to maximize POW gains for late game dominance
- **Babbler Rogue**: Complete as many challenges as possible (including group missions) for consistent bonus Glory accumulation
- **Neighbor Witch**: Save Arcane Alliance for critical moments, high-value challenges, or when you're completely depleted
- **Shadow Ninja**: Target weak players for safe gains, or gamble by targeting strong players who might succeed (mind games!)
- **Lost Dragon**: Always aim to spend 4+ points to trigger Dragon Rage - go big or go home!
- **Drunken Paladin**: High risk, high reward - but remember, no dice in friend or group challenges
- **Mute Monk**: Abuse meditation to restore critical stats - you're the only hero who benefits from it!
- **Lover Zombie**: Winning triggers Cursed Embrace to weaken all rivals - extremely powerful in group missions

### Shadow Ninja Advanced Strategy

- **Target Selection Psychology**: Pick players who are likely to fail (low stats) for safe gains, or gamble on strong players succeeding
- **Highest Stat Penalty**: If you have multiple stats tied for highest, the penalty is random - manage your stat distribution!
- **Zero-Stat Protection**: If your highest stat is 0, you can't lose more - use contracts aggressively when depleted
- **Timing**: Early game targeting is safer (more failures), late game is riskier (players have more resources)
- **Mind Games**: The target doesn't know they're marked - watch them sweat!

### Group Mission Strategy

1. **Check Soul Types** - Players with matching affinity should contribute more
2. **Vote Strategically** - If you're depleted or the challenge is too hard, vote NO
3. **Use Passives Wisely** - Lost Dragon's Dragon Rage shines in group missions
4. **Don't Be Greedy** - A -3 penalty to all stats can cripple your entire game
5. **Coordinate Resources** - Make sure the party has enough combined stats to succeed
6. **Consider Difficulty** - Hard mode gives +4 Glory but requires much more total contribution

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Missions in Pavel** embraces a medieval tavern aesthetic with:

- **Parchment textures** for an authentic ancient feel
- **Ancient scrolls** instead of modern UI elements
- **Ornate borders and decorations** inspired by illuminated manuscripts  
- **Animated dice** with realistic physics for gambling mechanics
- **Subtle atmospheric animations** (auras, glows, shimmers) that enhance without overwhelming
- **Warm color palette** of golds, browns, deep reds, and blacks
- **Medieval typography** (Cinzel Decorative, MedievalSharp, Almendra) for full immersion
- **Wax seals** for Glory counters and hero markers

The game balances **tactical depth** with **accessibility**, making it easy to learn but rewarding to master. Each hero's passive ability adds a unique flavor and strategic dimension, while group missions create memorable moments of cooperation (and blame when things go wrong!).
