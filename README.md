## 🎯 Game Strategy Tips

### General Strategy

1. **Master Your Passive** - Each hero's passive ability can turn the tide; learn to leverage it effectively
2. **Resource Conservation** - Remember, you only get 5 points back every 3 turns
3. **Use Meditations Wisely** - You only have 3 for the entire game
4. **Friend Challenges** - Great for difficult challenges when resources are low
5. **Soul-Type Matching** - The +3 bonus can make impossible challenges achievable
6. **Plan Ahead** - Think about the Alchemist visits when managing resources

### Hero-Specific Tips

- **Dark Stalker**: Use hidden spending to bluff opponents in friend challenges
- **Friendly AI**: Save System Override for impossible challenges
- **Thug Dwarf**: Take risks knowing you'll recover 1 point even on failures
- **Babbler Rogue**: Complete as many challenges as possible for bonus Glory
- **Neighbor Mage**: Save Ritual Circle for when BRN is high but required stat is low
- **Shadow Ninja**: Dominate SPD challenges with double effectiveness
- **Lost Dragon**: Go all-in with 5+ points for massive bonuses
- **Drunken Paladin**: Rely on luck - you have a 33% chance to auto-win each challenge!
- **Mute Monk**: Use all 4 meditations strategically to restore key stats
- **Lover Zombie**: Complete challenges early and often to snowball POW

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Missions of Pavel** embraces a medieval tavern aesthetic with:

- **Parchment textures** for an authentic feel
- **Ancient scrolls** instead of books for that extra medieval touch
- **Ornate borders and decorations** inspired by illuminated manuscripts  
- **Animated 3D dice** for gambling mechanics
- **Subtle animations** that enhance without overwhelming
- **Warm color palette** of golds, browns, deep reds, and yellows
- **Medieval typography** for immersion
- **Wood-carved title styling** reminiscent of tavern signs

The game balances **tactical depth** with **accessibility**, making it easy to learn but rewarding to master. Each hero's passive ability adds a layer of strategic variety that keeps every playthrough fresh.
