### Core Mechanics

- **Player to your left** draws a challenge card and chooses difficulty: Minor (1 Glory) or Deadly (2 Glory)
- **Active player** receives the device and decides their approach to the challenge
- After completing your turn, **pass the device** to the next player

**Resource Management:**
- 5 Attributes: POW (Power), SPD (Speed), BRN (Brain), CHA (Charisma), WIL (Willpower)

- **Spent points are consumed** and don't regenerate automatically
- Winning a challenge grants **+2 points back** to the stat you used!

**Soul-Type Advantage:**

   - Both fail → No Glory earned
   - **No dice gambling** in friend challenges - pure skill!

**Drink & Gamble:**

## 👥 Group Missions - NEW!

Sometimes the entire party faces a **Group Mission** (marked with 🤝). These cooperative challenges require **ALL heroes to work together**!

### How Group Missions Work

1. **Everyone Contributes** - Each player decides how many stat points to contribute (in turn order)
2. **Affinity Bonuses Apply** - Players still get +3 if their soul-type matches
3. **Passive Abilities Work** - Shadow Ninja's Double Strike, Lost Dragon's Dragon Rage, and more!
4. **Combined Total** - All contributions are added together (including bonuses)

### Rewards & Penalties

**If the party succeeds:**
- ✅ **Easy Mode:** Everyone gains **+2 Glory**
- ✅ **Hard Mode:** Everyone gains **+4 Glory**
- ✅ **Thug Dwarf:** Gains +3 POW (Brute Force passive)
- ✅ **Babbler Rogue:** Counts toward Crowd Favorite bonus
- ✅ **Lover Zombie:** Cursed Embrace triggers (if in party)

**If the party fails:**
- ❌ **Everyone loses -3 to ALL stats** (POW, SPD, BRN, CHA, WIL)
- ❌ No Glory for anyone
- ❌ No gambling - failure is absolute

### Special Rules for Group Missions

- **No Dice Rolls** - Drunken Paladin cannot use Liquid Courage
- **No Skipping** - Everyone must participate (no meditation)
- **Friendly AI** - Can use System Override to contribute a different stat
- **Neighbor Witch** - Can borrow from another player's required stat
- **Coordination is Key** - Discuss strategy with your party!

### Example Group Missions

- 🌊 **The Great Swamp Flood** - Pavel is sinking! Bail water together!
- 🐉 **Dragon's Siege** - A dragon attacks the pub! Fight as one!
- 🍺 **The King's Banquet** - King Antony needs 5000 beers NOW!
- 👹 **Ork Horde Stand** - Push back the invaders at the pub door!
- 🔥 **Village Fire Brigade** - The pub is burning! Pass water bags quickly!

## 🎯 Game Strategy Tips

### General Strategy

1. **Master Your Passive** - Each hero's passive ability can turn the tide; learn to leverage it effectively
2. **Resource Conservation** - You get +2 back on wins, but losses hurt. Plan ahead for the Alchemist visits
3. **Use Meditations Wisely** - You only have 3 for the entire game
4. **Friend Challenges** - Great for difficult challenges when resources are low (no dice gambling though!)
5. **Soul-Type Matching** - The +3 bonus can make impossible challenges achievable
6. **Group Mission Coordination** - Don't let the party down! Communicate strategy
7. **Watch the Alchemist Schedule** - Visits become more frequent as the game progresses

### Hero-Specific Tips

- **Dark Stalker**: Use Shadow Control strategically to skip strong opponents or force meditation before big challenges
- **Friendly AI**: Save System Override for impossible challenges or group missions
- **Thug Dwarf**: Snowballs hard - prioritize winning early to maximize POW gains
- **Babbler Rogue**: Complete as many challenges as possible (including group missions) for bonus Glory
- **Neighbor Witch**: Save Arcane Alliance for critical moments or group missions
- **Shadow Ninja**: Dominate SPD challenges with double effectiveness - incredible in SPD group missions!
- **Lost Dragon**: Go all-in with 4+ points for massive bonuses (works in group missions too!)
- **Drunken Paladin**: High risk, high reward - but remember, no dice in friend or group challenges
- **Mute Monk**: Use all 3 meditations strategically to restore key stats when needed
- **Lover Zombie**: Complete challenges to trigger Cursed Embrace and weaken rivals

### Group Mission Strategy

1. **Check Soul Types** - Players with matching affinity should contribute more
2. **Use Passives Wisely** - Shadow Ninja and Lost Dragon shine in group missions
3. **Don't Be Greedy** - A -3 penalty to all stats hurts everyone badly
4. **Coordinate Resources** - Make sure someone can contribute meaningfully
5. **Consider Difficulty** - Hard mode gives +4 Glory but is much riskier

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Missions in Pavel** embraces a medieval tavern aesthetic with:

- **Parchment textures** for an authentic feel
- **Ancient scrolls** instead of books for that extra medieval touch
- **Ornate borders and decorations** inspired by illuminated manuscripts  
- **Animated dice** for gambling mechanics
- **Subtle animations** that enhance without overwhelming
- **Warm color palette** of golds, browns, deep reds, and blacks
- **Medieval typography** for immersion
- **Wax seals** for Glory counters

The game balances **tactical depth** with **accessibility**, making it easy to learn but rewarding to master. Each hero's passive ability adds a layer of strategic variety, and group missions create moments of cooperation that keep every playthrough fresh and exciting.
